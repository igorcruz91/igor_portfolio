# Data Projects Portfolio

Here are some of my data projects. I am constantly uploading new projects or updating old ones.

### [Project 1: Prediction of the top scorer of the Brazilian football championship](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20Prediction%20of%20the%20top%20scorer%20of%20the%20Brazilian%20football%20championship)

This project aims to predict how many goals the top scorer has scored in each brazilian championship from 1959 to 2022.


### [Project 2: Weather Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%202%20Weather%20Prediction)

This project goal is to predict the weather temperature using historical data from 1960-2022.


### [Project 3: Clustering FIFA 22 players](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%203)

This project was designed to implement k-means clustering to all FIFA 22 players in order to find patterns in our data and analyze some results.


### [Project 4: Handwritten Classification using Neural Networks](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%204%20Neural%20Networks)

This project goal is to implement different classification algorithms such as K-Nearst Neighbors and Neural Networks and compare their performances.

### [Project 5: Quantum SVM for binary classification](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%205%20QSVM)
This project aims to use quantum support vector machine in order to classify digits, and later compare its performance with a classical KNN algorithm.
