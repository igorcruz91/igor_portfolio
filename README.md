# Data Projects Portfolio

Here are some of my data projects. I am constantly uploading new projects or updating old ones.

### [Project 1: Quantum SVM for binary classification](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%205%20QSVM)
This project aims to use quantum support vector machine in order to classify digits, and later compare its performance with a classical KNN algorithm.

### [Project 2: ETL Pipeline with Airflow on AWS EC2]
In this data engineering project, I acquired knowledge on constructing and automating an ETL pipeline capable of retrieving up-to-date weather data from the Open Weather map API. I then proceed to process the data and store it into an S3 bucket, all orchestrated through Apache Airflow.
