# Data Projects Portfolio

Here are some of my data projects. I am constantly uploading new projects or updating old ones.

### [Project 1: Quantum SVM for binary classification](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/Project%205%20QSVM)
This project aims to use quantum support vector machine in order to classify digits, and later compare its performance with a classical KNN algorithm.

### [Project 2: ETL Pipeline with Airflow on AWS EC2](https://github.com/igorcruz91/igor_portfolio/tree/main/ETL%20OpenWeather)
In this data engineering project, I acquired knowledge on constructing and automating an ETL pipeline capable of retrieving up-to-date weather data from the Open Weather map API. I then proceed to process the data and store it into an S3 bucket, all orchestrated through Apache Airflow.

### [Project 3: Chatting with PDF through OpenAI]()
This project is an application I made that allows the user to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content, using Langchain and Streamlit. In the example, I uploaded my master's thesis and asked the bot some questions about the text (the application allows multiple PDF files).
